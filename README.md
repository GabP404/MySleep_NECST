# Welcome to MySleep project. 
This web app is built with the React front-end framework. I used npm as packet manager.
There also used library like:
  #SheetJS
  #Material-UI
  #Recharts
  #React-router
  
  
## Description
Professionals of the health sectors ranging from nutritionists to sleep researchers suggest using diaries to keep track of daily habits as a means to develop awareness, create accountability, and generate a sense of accomplishment.
While useful in these directions, diaries end up containing a considerable amount of information that users either never look through or must analyze manually and in raw format. MySleep is built to visualize data in a useful and effective way. First of all, the web interface gives the opportunity to see meaningful data obtained after a data analysis. Secondly, is possible to compare data from different times in other to gain more consciousness about the lifestyle of the user and his journey throughout the year. Last but not least, this tool provides an aesthetically pleasing experience very easy to use. 

Here some picture of the interface:
